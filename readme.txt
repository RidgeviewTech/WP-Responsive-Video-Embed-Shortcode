---WP Video Embed Code<---

Here's an example of what you could do with this

[youtube_embed src="heu467h" float="right" left="100" bottom="30" max-width="300"]

Add any of the following attributes to the shortcode to control position and size. You can also ONLY use src and the video will be placed at 100% and respond within the containing page element.

For all of these items, please only add integers. everything is handled in px.

src = only use the YouTube id.  To be clear, please reference the example above.  ONLY use the vide embed code.
max-width = "xx"
float = "left", "right"
left = padding in px to the left of the video
right = padding in px to the right of the video
bottom = padding in px below the bottom of the video
top = padding in px above the top of the video
